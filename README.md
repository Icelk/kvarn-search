# Kvarn search

Uses [elipdotter](https://github.com/Icelk/elipdotter)
to provide search capabilities for a Kvarn host.

Uses the file system and [`prepare_single`](https://doc.kvarn.org/kvarn/extensions/struct.Extensions.html#method.get_prepare_single)
extensions to get all documents to index.

> This means this implementation currently does not crawl the local site.
